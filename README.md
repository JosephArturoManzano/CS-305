# CS-305

Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
Artemis Financial was the client we were providing security enhancements for their company. I wanted improved security methods.
What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?
I found that my organization was one of my strong suits. Coding securely prevents outside, breaches to gain information or data.
What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you? 
Creating a server was the most difficult part for me.
How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
http to https was the added layer of protection for the last project.
How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
Using a test, I was able to confirm I added no vulnrebilities.
What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
I think a coding thesaurus would be the most beneficial book one could buy.
